# trans-pytorch

**my first deep learning project which's code is constructed by pytorch. I will betray Tensorflow, and good luck to me.**

trans-pytorch is a deep learning project about Neural Machine Translation, the model is simple, which is encoder-decoder based and use GRU as the cell of Recurrent Neueral Netword. and incorporate attention mechanism to get higher quality translation results.
